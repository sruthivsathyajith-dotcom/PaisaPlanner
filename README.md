### Project Description
A Budget planner app for the procrastination generation! This a money tracking app made for college students, where we remove the extra time required to manually enter expenditure, beacause honestly, who has the time?! We have also incorporated a split function, AI powered suggestions and an analytics report at the month end so that the savings can be optimized.

### The Problem statement
Forgetting to log in the expenditure and losing track of your money.

### The Solution
A POP UP!!! We have incorporated a pop up widget that will appear right after the payment is made using a upi app (preferably Gpay). This way the user need not enter the category manually in the app,  and save time.
